## Introduction  
Travel Buddy is an Android application that helps people to find companies to travel with. Just imagine the situation that you want to have a nice trip but are unable to find a friend who is available or agree with you on the same destination. Will you give up the plan? No way. Why not try our **Travel Buddy**? By using **Travel Buddy**, it is as easy as 1, 2, 3 to find people who have the same idea with you. You are able to chat with each other and then decide if you would like to have a great journey together.
